=== System components and structure

openTCS consists of the following components running as separate processes and working together in a client-server architecture:

* Kernel (server process), running vehicle-independent strategies and drivers for controlled vehicles
* Clients
** Plant overview for modelling and visualizing the plant model
** Kernel control center for controlling and monitoring the kernel, e.g. providing a detailed view of vehicles/their associated drivers
** Arbitrary clients for comunicating with other systems, e.g. for process control or warehouse management

The purpose of the openTCS kernel is to provide an abstract driving model of a transportation system/plant, to manage transport orders and to compute routes for the vehicles.
Clients can communicate with this server process to, for instance, modify the plant model, to visualize the driving course and the processing of transport orders and to create new transport orders.
For user interaction, the kernel provides a graphical user interface titled Kernel Control Center.
Additionally there's also a standalone/remote version of the Kernel Control Center.

IMPORTANT: The Kernel Control Center GUI provided by the kernel application is deprecated and scheduled for removal with version 5.0. 
A separate Kernel Control Center application is available and should be used instead.

Three major strategy modules within the kernel implement processing of transport orders:

* A dispatcher that decides which transport order should be processed by which vehicle.
  Additionally, it needs to decide what vehicles should do in certain situation, e.g. when there aren't any transport orders or when a vehicle is running low on energy.
* A router which finds optimal routes for vehicles to reach their destinations.
* A scheduler that manages resource allocations for traffic management, i.e. to avoid vehicles crashing into each other.

The openTCS distribution comes with default implementations for each of these strategies.
These implementations can be easily replaced by a developer to adapt to environment-specific requirements.

The driver framework that is part of the openTCS kernel manages communication channels and associates vehicle drivers with vehicles.
A vehicle driver is an adapter between kernel and vehicle and translates each vehicle-specific communication protocol to the kernel's internal communication schemes and vice versa.
Furthermore, a driver may offer low-level functionality to the user via the kernel's graphical user interface, e.g. manually sending telegrams to the associated vehicle.
By using suitable vehicle drivers, vehicles of different types can be managed simultaneously by a single openTCS instance.

The plant overview client that is part of the openTCS distribution allows editing of plant models, which can be loaded into the kernel.
This includes, for instance, the definition of load-change stations, driving tracks and vehicles.
In the kernel's plant operation mode, the plant overview client is used to display the transportation system's general state and any active transport processes, and to create new transport orders interactively.

The kernel control center client that is part of the openTCS distribution allows controlling and monitoring the kernel.
Part of that is assigning vehicle drivers to vehicles and controlling them by enabling the communication and monitoring them by displaying vehicle state information, for instance.

Other clients, e.g. to control higher-level plant processes, can be implemented and attached.
For Java clients, the openTCS kernel provides an interface based on Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
A host interface for creating transport orders using XML telegrams sent via TCP/IP connections is also available.
Additionally, openTCS provides a web API for creating and withdrawing transport orders and retrieving transport order status updates.

=== Plant model elements

In openTCS, a plant model consists of a set of the following elements.
The attributes of these elements that are relevant for the plant model, e.g. the coordinates of a point or the length of a path, can be edited using the plant overview client (in modelling mode).

==== Point

Points are logical mappings of discrete vehicle positions in the driving course.
In plant operation mode, vehicles are ordered (and thus move) from one point to another in the model.
A point carries the following attributes:

* A _type_, which is one of these three:
** _Halt position_:
   Indicates a position at which a vehicle may halt temporarily while processing an order, e.g. for executing an operation.
   The vehicle is expected to report in when it arrives at such a position.
   It may not remain here for longer than necessary, though.
   Halt position is the default type for points when modelling with the plant overview client.
** _Reporting position_:
   Indicates a position at which a vehicle is expected to report in _only_.
   Vehicles will not be ordered to a reporting position, and halting or even parking at such a position is not allowed.
   Therefore a route that only consists of reporting points will be unroutable because the vehicle is not able to halt at any position.
** _Park position_:
   Indicates a position at which a vehicle may halt for longer periods of time when it is not processing orders.
   The vehicle is also expected to report in when it arrives at such a position.
* A _position_, i.e. the point's coordinates in the plant's coordinate system.
* A _vehicle orientation angle_, which expresses the vehicle's assumed/expected orientation while it occupies the point.

===== Layout coordinates vs model coordinates

A point has two sets of coordinates: layout coordinates and model coordinates.
The layout coordinates are merely intended for the graphical presentation in the plant overview client, while the model coordinates are data that a vehicle driver could potentially use or send to the vehicle it communicates with (e.g. if the vehicle needs the exact coordinates of a destination point for navigation).
Both coordinate sets are not tied to each other per se, i.e. they may differ.
This is to allow coordinates that the system works with internally to be different from the presentation; for example, you may want to provide a distorted view on the driving course simply because some paths in your plant are very long and you mainly want to view all points/locations closely
together.
Dragging points and therefore changing their position in the graphical presentation only affects the corresponding layout coordinates.

To synchronize the layout coordinates with the model coordinates or the other way around you have two options:

* Select menu:Actions[Copy model values to layout] or menu:Actions[Copy layout values to model] to synchronize them globally.
* Select a single layout element, right click it and select menu:Context menu[Copy model values to layout] or menu:Context menu[Copy layout values to model] to synchronize them only for the selected element.

==== Path

Paths are connections between points that are navigable for vehicles.
A path's main attributes, next to its source and destination point, are:

* Its _length_, which may be a relevant information for a vehicle in plant operation mode.
  Depending on the router configuration, it may also be used for computing routing costs/finding an optimal route to a destination point.
* A _maximum velocity_ and _maximum reverse velocity_, which may be a relevant information for a vehicle in plant operation mode.
  Depending on the router configuration, it may also be used for computing routing costs/finding an optimal route to a destination point.
* A _routing cost_, which is an explicit, unitless value.
  Depending on the router configuration, it may be used for computing routing costs/finding an optimal route to a destination point.
* A _locked_ flag, which, when set, tells the router that the path may not be used when computing routes for vehicles.

==== Location

Locations are markers for points at which vehicles may execute special operations (load or unload cargo, charge their battery etc.).
A location's attributes are:

* Its _type_, basically defining which operations are allowed at the location -- see <<Location type>>.
* A set of _links_ to points that the location can be reached from.
  To be of any use for vehicles in the plant model, a location needs to be linked to at least one point.

==== Location type

Location types are abstract elements that group locations.
A location type has only one relevant attribute:

* A set of _allowed operations_, defining which operations a vehicle may execute at locations of this type.

==== Vehicle

Vehicles map physical vehicles for the purpose of communicating with them and visualizing their positions and other characteristics.
A vehicle provides the following attributes:

* A _critical energy level_, which is the threshold below which the vehicle's energy level is considered critical.
  This value may be used at plant operation time to decide when it is crucial to recharge a vehicle's energy storage.
* A _good energy level_, which is the threshold above which the vehicle's energy level is considered good.
  This value may be used at plant operation time to decide when it is unnecessary to recharge a vehicle's energy storage.
* A _maximum velocity_ and _maximum reverse velocity_.
  Depending on the router configuration, it may be used for computing routing costs/finding an optimal route to a destination point.
* An _integration level_, indicating how far the vehicle is currently allowed to be integrated into the system.
  A vehicle can be
  ** ..._ignored_:
      The vehicle and its reported position will be ignored completely, thus the vehicle will not be displayed in the plant overview.
      The vehicle is not available for transport orders.
  ** ..._noticed_:
      The vehicle will be displayed at its reported position in the plant overview, but no resources will be allocated in the system for that position.
      The vehicle is not available for transport orders.
  ** ..._respected_:
      The resources for the vehicle's reported position will be allocated.
      The vehicle is not available for transport orders. 
  ** ..._utilized_:
     The vehicle is available for transport orders and will be utilized by the openTCS.
* A set of _processable transport order categories_, which are strings used for filtering transport orders assigned to the vehicle.
  Also see <<Transport order>>.
* A _route color_, which is the color used for visualizing the route the vehicle is taking to its destination.

==== Block

Blocks (or block areas) are areas in which only a single vehicle may operate at the same time.
They are useful to prevent deadlock situations, e.g. at path intersections or dead ends.
A block has a single relevant attribute:

* A set of _members_, i.e. points, paths and/or locations that the block is composed of.

=== Plant operation elements

Transport orders and order sequences are elements that are available only at plant operation time.
Their attributes are primarily set when the respective elements are created.

==== Transport order

A transport order is a parameterized sequence of movements and operations to be processed by a vehicle.
When creating a transport order, the following attributes can be set:

* A sequence of _destinations_ that the processing vehicle must process (in their given order).
  Each destination consists of a location that the vehicle must travel to and an operation that it must perform there.
* An optional _deadline_, indicating when the transport order is supposed to have been processed.
* An optional _category_, which is a string used for filtering vehicles that may be assigned to the transport order.
  A vehicle may only be assigned to a transport order if the order's category is in the vehicle's set of processable categories.
  (Examples for potentially useful categories are `"Transport"` and `"Maintenance"`.)
* An optional _intended vehicle_, telling the dispatcher to assign the transport order to the specified vehicle instead of selecting one automatically.

==== Order sequence

An order sequence describes a process spanning multiple transport orders which are to be executed subsequently by a single vehicle.
They can be used when the whole process cannot be mapped to a single transport order, for instance because some steps are only known after processing previous ones.
An order sequence carries the following attributes:

* A sequence of _transport orders_, which may be extended as long the complete flag (see below) is not set, yet.
* A _complete_ flag, indicating that no further transport orders will be added to the sequence.
  This cannot be reset.
* A _failure fatal_ flag, indicating that, if one transport order in the sequence fails, all orders following it should immediately be considered as failed, too.
* An optional _category_ -- see <<Transport order>>.
  If set, categories set with transport orders in the sequence will be ignored.
* An optional _intended vehicle_, telling the dispatcher to assign the order sequence to the specified vehicle instead of selecting one automatically.
  If set, all transport orders added to the order sequence must carry the same intended vehicle value.

NOTE: The plant overview application currently does not provide a way to create order sequences.
They can only created programmatically, using dedicated clients that are not part of the openTCS distribution.

=== Common element attributes

==== Unique name

Every plant model and plant operation element has a unique name identifying it in the system, regardless of what type of element it is.
Two elements may not be given the same name, even if e.g. one is a point and the other one is a transport order.

==== Generic properties

In addition to the listed attributes, it is possible to define arbitrary properties as key-value pairs for all driving course elements, which for example can be read and evaluated by vehicle drivers or client software.
Both the key and the value can be arbitrary character strings.
For example, a key-value pair `"IP address"`:``"192.168.23.42"`` could be defined for a vehicle in the model, stating which IP address is to be used to communicate with the vehicle; a vehicle driver could now check during runtime whether a value for the key `"IP address"` was defined, and if yes, use it to automatically configure the communication channel to the vehicle.
Another use for these generic attributes can be vehicle-specific actions to be executed on certain paths in the model.
If a vehicle should, for instance, issue an acoustic warning and/or turn on the right-hand direction indicator when currently on a certain path,
attributes with the keys `"acoustic warning"` and/or `"right-hand direction indicator"` could be defined for this path and evaluated by the respective vehicle driver.

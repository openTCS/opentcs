=== System components and structure

openTCS consists of the following components running as separate processes and working together in a client-server architecture:

* Kernel (server process), running vehicle-independent strategies and drivers for controlled vehicles
* Clients
** Plant overview for modelling and visualizing the plant model
** Arbitrary clients for comunicating with other systems, e.g. for process control or warehouse management

The purpose of the openTCS kernel is to provide an abstract driving model of a transportation system/plant, to manage transport orders and to compute routes for the vehicles.
Clients can communicate with this server process to, for instance, modify the plant model, to visualize the driving course and the processing of transport orders and to create new transport orders.
For user interaction, the kernel provides a graphical user interface titled Kernel Control Center.

The driver framework that is part of the openTCS kernel manages communication channels and associates vehicle drivers with vehicles.
A vehicle driver is an adapter between kernel and vehicle and translates each vehicle-specific communication protocol to the kernel's internal communication schemes and vice versa.
Furthermore, a driver may offer low-level functionality to the user via the kernel's graphical user interface, e.g. manually sending telegrams to the associated vehicle.
By using suitable vehicle drivers, vehicles of different types can be managed simultaneously by a single openTCS instance.

The plant overview client that is part of the openTCS distribution allows editing of plant models, which can be loaded into the kernel.
This includes, for instance, the definition of load-change stations, driving tracks and vehicles.
In the kernel's plant operation mode, the plant overview client is used to display the transportation system's general state and any active transport processes, and to create new transport orders interactively.

Other clients, e.g. to control higher-level plant processes, can be implemented and attached.
For Java clients, the openTCS kernel provides an interface based on Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
A host interface for creating transport orders using XML telegrams sent via TCP/IP connections is also available.

=== Elements of plant models

In openTCS, a plant model consists of the following elements:

* _Points_ are logical mappings of discrete positions reported by a vehicle.
In plant operation mode, vehicles move from one point to another in the model.
A point can have one of the following types:
** Halt position:
Indicates a position at which a vehicle may halt temporarily, e.g. for executing an operation.
The vehicle is also expected to report in when it arrives at such a position.
It may not park here for longer than necessary, though.
Halt position is the default type for points when modelling with the plant overview client.
** Reporting position:
Indicates a position at which a vehicle is expected to report in.
Halting or even parking at such a position is not allowed.
Therefore a route that only consists of reporting points will be unroutable because the vehicle is not able to halt at any position.
** Park position:
Indicates a position at which a vehicle may halt for longer periods of time when it is not processing orders.
The vehicle is also expected to report in when it arrives at such a position.
* _Paths_ are connections between points that are navigable for vehicles.
* _Locations_ are places at which vehicles may execute special operations (change their load, charge their battery etc.).
To be reachable for any vehicle in the model, a location needs to be linked to at least one point.
* _Vehicles_ map real vehicles for the purpose of visualizing their positions and other characteristics.

Furthermore, there is an abstract element that is only used indirectly:

* _Location types_ group stations and define operations that can be executed by vehicles at these stations.

The attributes of these elements that are relevant for the driving course model, e.g. the coordinates of a point or the length of a path, can be edited using the plant overview client.

[NOTE]
.Layout coordinates vs model coordinates
====
A point has two sets of coordinates: layout coordinates and model coordinates.
The layout coordinates are merely intended for the graphical presentation in the plant overview client, while the model coordinates are data that a vehicle driver could potentially use or send to the vehicle it communicates with (e.g. if the vehicle needs the exact coordinates of a destination point for navigation).
Both coordinate sets are not tied to each other per se, i.e. they may differ.
This is to allow coordinates that the system works with internally to be different from the presentation; for example, you may want to provide a distorted view on the driving course simply because some paths in your plant are very long and you mainly want to view all points/locations closely
together.
Dragging points and therefore changing their position in the graphical presentation only affects the corresponding layout coordinates.

To synchronize the layout coordinates with the model coordinates or the other way around you have two options:

* Select menu:Actions[Copy model values to layout] or menu:Actions[Copy layout values to model] to synchronize them globally.
* Select a single layout element, right click it and select menu:Context menu[Copy model values to layout] or menu:Context menu[Copy layout values to model] to synchronize them only for the selected element.
====

Furthermore, it is possible to define arbitrary additional attributes as key-value pairs for all driving course elements, which for example can be read and evaluated by vehicle drivers or client software.
Both the key and the value can be arbitrary character strings.
For example, a key-value pair `"IP address"`:``"192.168.23.42"`` could be defined for a vehicle in the model, stating which IP address is to be used to communicate with the vehicle; a vehicle driver could now check during runtime whether a value for the key `"IP address"` was defined, and if yes, use it to automatically configure the communication channel to the vehicle.
Another use for these generic attributes can be vehicle-specific actions to be executed on certain paths in the model.
If a vehicle should, for instance, issue an acoustic warning and/or turn on the right-hand direction indicator when currently on a certain path,
attributes with the keys `"acoustic warning"` and/or `"right-hand direction indicator"` could be defined for this path and evaluated by the respective vehicle driver.

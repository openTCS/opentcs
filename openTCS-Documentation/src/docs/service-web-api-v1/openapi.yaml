  description: >-
    Bodies of HTTP requests and responses, where applicable, are JSON structures.
    The encoding used may be UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.
    Where time stamps are used, they are encoded using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601); the time zone used is UTC.


    The TCP port to be used for the HTTP requests is configuration-dependent; by default, it is 55200.


    By default, requests are accepted without requiring any authentication.
    Optionally, an access key can be set in the kernel configuration.
    The configured value is then expected to be sent by the client in an HTTP header named `X-Api-Access-Key`.
  # IMPORTANT: When updating this version number, remember to mention that in the changelog, too!
